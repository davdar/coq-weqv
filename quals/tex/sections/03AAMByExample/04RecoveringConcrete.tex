The final delta abstraction resulted in a highly factorized state space,
amenable to a wide range of analyses.

Before manipulating these axis of parameterization, we first show how to
recover a concrete interpreter.

Out semantics has two axis of parameterization: abstract address, value space
and delta functions.

For abstract address we pick the integers, and for delta function
